\cvsection{Profile}
Passionate AI Engineer with extensive experience in both software development and scientific research. I love to solve complex problems with efficient, cutting-edge solutions, bridging technical and scientific expertise to drive innovation.
I am very ambitious, always aiming at the top, but to achieve great things it is fundamental to work together with great people.
My background includes not only software development, data science, and machine learning, but also precious soft skills earned during my PhD: Mentoring, public speaking, problem-solving, and critical thinking.
