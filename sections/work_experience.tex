	\cvexperience{Software Engineer - Data \& AI}{Freelancer}
	{Italy}{2019 – 2020}
	Worked as a freelance software engineer for several AI-based projects. Specifically:

	\begin{itemize}

		\item LLM-based chatbot, fine-tuned on scientific articles to answer questions on COVID-19, to serve as a reliable source of information to mitigate the diffusion of fake news.
		
		\item Search-engine for textual documents (Elasticsearch), specifically designed to easily retrieve court decisions. The data ingestion was performed by applying NLP techniques to extract the relevant information and metadata.
		
		\item Life-saving mobile app to call nearby BSLD operators in case of heart-related emergencies.
		
	\end{itemize}
